# aapis-grpcurl

Interact with gRPC servers using custom APIs.

A wrapped version of the [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) tool that points to [my custom API](https://github.com/goromal/aapis) definitions.

Since I use gRPC for inter-process communication for most simulated robot platform personal projects, this is a useful CLI tool for debugging.
