# flask-oatbox

"One at a time" (O.A.T.) Box. Store one file at a time, powered by Python's flask library.

```bash
usage: flask_oatbox [-h] [--port PORT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --port PORT  Port to run the server on
```

This tool gives you a method to store, extract, and replace files (again, one at a time) in the directory from which the tool is run.
