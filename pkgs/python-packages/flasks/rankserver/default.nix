    longDescription = ''
      Spins up a flask webserver (on the specified port) whose purpose is to help a user rank files in the chosen `data-dir` directory via manual binary comparisons. The ranking is done via an incremental "RESTful" sorting strategy implemented within the [pysorting](./pysorting.md) library. State is created and maintained within the `data-dir` directory so that the ranking exercise can pick back up where it left off between different spawnings of the server. At this point, only the ranking of `.txt` and `.png` files is possible; other file types in `data-dir` will be ignored.
