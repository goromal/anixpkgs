      For your photos management, follow these steps:

      1. Favorite *only* the media that you would like to "thin out"
      2. On a computer with space, run the clean method
      3. Move the whole Favorites directory to the trash
    '';
    autoGenUsageCmd = "--help";
    subCmds = [ "clean" ];
  };
}
